# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Sociology and Interim Director of Nonprofit Leadership program at Minnesota State University, Mankato.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the formation and evolution of social networks and their implications for the creation of social inequality. Social networks are important because they have powerful and often hidden influences on social behavior. Micro-level network processes scale up to help explain aggregate variation in power and resources across social groups. Much of my research utilizes quantitative and computational social science methods to analyze large-scale datasets.

My current research projects: 1) explore network structures at work-related virtual platforms and how the networks affect individuals and organizations; 2) investigate how institutional conditions shape the access to employment opportunities through social networks; 3) examine how social networks impact health outcomes while accounting for individual genetic predisposition, aiming to better understand causal network effects.
